# Cookie-Clicker
This project is intended to be a cookie clicker, which would increment a single cookie per second alongside upgrades to purchase a cookie when available, as a fun game.

My work did lack a lot of areas, specifically in js where concepts issues affected code writing.
I learnt a lot more about time management when creating a project with an area you have difficulty on, as this meant not much time could be dedicated to the css.
However, I am determined to fully comprehend the necessary knowledge of js in order to code a new fully developed cookie clicker.
